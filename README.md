## How did the project comes to life? (design)

- Plan
Notion + plan of the project how I arrange days and weeks

- Design
Ideation
Survey, interviews. (screenshots)
BMC & Card sorting

User stories


After research I started design
Initial sketching (see the light)

Data architect (Class UML Diagram, Json tree, User flow diagram)

UI Design (UI Screens, prototype)
App icon + app name

- Develop
Clickable prototype in Figma

- Test
run the prototype on figma &| xcode
Usability testing

- Evaluate
I can add something about outcomes of the test and iterations I did + what moved to future plan or next versions.

And so on... until at least satisfying from the work.. no work is 100% perfect, even in super successful projects, always there is things to inhance
