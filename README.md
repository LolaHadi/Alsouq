## About
What is it and what it did

## What is the need
what is the need or where problem starts

## How did the project comes to life? (design)
### Meet
I may write something here about what required from the supervisors.\

### Plan
Notion + plan of the project how I arrange days and weeks\

### Design 
Research includes: Survey to make sure there is a need.\
Ideation includes: Idea + Sketching + User stories\
Resuming research includes: Survey, Interviews, App categories (surveys + card sorting), Competitive analysis...\

After research I started design\
Initial version1 wireframe

Data architect (Class UML Diagram, Json tree, User flow diagram)\

Completed version2 wireframe\

UI Design (UI Screens, prototype)\
App icon + app name

### Develop
Clickable prototype in Figma (useability testing moved due to lack of time)

### Test
run the prototype on figma &| xcode
Usability testing

### Evaluate
I can add something about outcomes of the test and iterations I did + what moved to future plan or next versions.

And so on... until at least satisfying from the work within the time.. no work is 100% perfect, even in super successful projects, always there is things to inhance


## How did the project come to life? (develop)
### Plan
My plan and how I allocate time to tasks

### Design
Archetucture of the files in xcode + MVC

### Develop
Choosing between storyboard or programmatically
Start coding + dependencies I will need + github repo

### Test
Useability testing process moved here + this is not the perfect case but no time.

### Evaluate 
testing outcomes + project ready to .....

## Let's have a closer look at (Alsouq) (App Demo)
A video recording of the app + firebase
Or Screenshots + explanation


## What's ext?
Things that I did not have time to do and I will do them in the next versions.

## What I personally loved or Strong points
//.. May deleted

## Difficulties or limitations
- Dificult to cover all Saudi regons!\

- Time limitations\
theres always things to fix.

- Jump/ playing between different roles. 

- You are the judge! 
The given requirements were so general and open! The option was open to you, you determine the level of quality of your project based on what you decide for yourself and bear the consequences. You either have the choice to be more creative and facinate everyone but you have to put in more effort, or you can choose just to cover the minimum requirements and pass the bootcamp.. Nobody judging you, you are the judge of yourself.


## Next versons?
- Putting more effort in research part. 
- Putting more effort in visual identity.
- Conducting usability tests on the flow and taking outcomes into account in next iterations.
- Test theproduct on a small group of users (MVB).
- Enlarge the scope of users and observe. 
- Add online payment feature.
- Adding a wholesale system, but for several people, so that each person chooses the percentage of the existing quantity and the price is determined based on the quantity purchased, so that parts can be purchased at the wholesale price.
- Expanding the scope to the global.
